# Hi, I'm Donovan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product manager and web developer who is passionate about making software that facilitates learning and benefits the welfare of people everywhere. Some technologies I enjoy working with are JavaScript, ReactJS, and Ruby.  For a recent Code Louisville class project I created __My Guinea Piggies__ (https://github.com/donovanmosley/gp1), an in-depth learning resource that shows potential pet owners what to expect from owning a guinea pig and how to connect with the right type.

**Fun factâš¡:** When Iâ€™m not coding you can find me reading, rollerblading, and learning Spanish.
